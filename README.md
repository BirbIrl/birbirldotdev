Interactive landing page i made to refresh my memory on html, css and javascript. Made with 0 dependencies. I did use a couple things on the way there for prototyping, though. You can see it in the commit history.

Like always, everything i publish is realased under the GPL 3.0, so this is here as well.

This isn't worth your time. Check out this cooler project someone else made instead: [Chevron](https://github.com/kholmogorov27/chevron).
